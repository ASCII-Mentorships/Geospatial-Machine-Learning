# Geospatial-Machine-Learning

The project is within remote sensing and drone related computer vision. Check out this link https://spacenet.ai/ to get an idea of the datasets and challenges. We will be deciding the exact problem statement later considering the scope and difficulty.

## Topics Involved
Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Image Processing, Computer Vision.  
(If you have knowledge on the topics involved then that would be a plus but even if you don't, no need to worry, you will learn along with the project.)
